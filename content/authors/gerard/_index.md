I am from Singapore. I am a doctoral candidate at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill School of Social Work.

My dissertation will focus on risk factors of maltreatment rereports. My 
[first paper](https://gerardchung.shinyapps.io/shiny_metaanalysis_effects/) will be a meta-analysis of risk factors of maltreatment rereports. My second paper will do a cross-study synthesis of risk factors using machine learning. My third paper will use a Bayesian spatiotemporal framework to analyze risk factors associated with child maltreatment rereports across counties. 

My research interests include parenting, engaging fathers in services, risk factors of child maltreatment, and predictive modeling. I also identify as a methodologist in social work research where the through line connecting my research interests involved the use of computational social science methods and other advanced statistical methods.

My [recent study](http://sgcovidparenting.mystrikingly.com/) looked at parenting during COVID-19 pandemic in Singapore. Our first [paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10896-020-00200-1) looking at parenting stress has been published.
